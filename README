NAME
    pyproj

DESCRIPTION
    Pyrex wrapper to provide python interfaces to 
    PROJ.4 (http://proj.maptools.org) functions.
    
    Performs cartographic transformations (converts from longitude,latitude
    to native map projection x,y coordinates and vice versa, or from
    one map projection coordinate system directly to another).
    
    Example usage:
    
    >>> from pyproj import Proj
    >>> p = Proj(proj='utm',zone=10,ellps='WGS84')
    >>> x,y = p(-120.108, 34.36116666)
    >>> print x,y
    >>> print p(x,y,inverse=True)
    765975.641091 3805993.13406
    (-120.10799999995851, 34.361166659972767)
    
    Input coordinates can be given as python arrays, lists/tuples, scalars
    or numpy/Numeric/numarray arrays. Optimized for objects that support
    the Python buffer protocol (regular python and numpy array objects).
    
    Download: http://python.org/pypi/pyproj
    
    Requirements: PROJ.4 library (http://proj.maptools.org).
    
    Install:  Set the PROJ_DIR environment variable to point to the location 
              of your proj.4 installation, then run 'python setup.py install'.
              If you're using Windows with mingw, see README.mingw.
    
    Example scripts are in 'test' subdirectory of source distribution.

CLASSES
    __builtin__.object
        Proj
    
    class Proj(__builtin__.object)
     |  performs cartographic transformations (converts from longitude,latitude
     |  to native map projection x,y coordinates and vice versa) using proj 
     |  (http://proj.maptools.org/)
     |  
     |  A Proj class instance is initialized with 
     |  proj map projection control parameter key/value pairs.
     |  The key/value pairs can either be passed in a dictionary,
     |  or as keyword arguments.
     |  See http://www.remotesensing.org/geotiff/proj_list for
     |  examples of key/value pairs defining different map projections.
     |  
     |  Calling a Proj class instance with the arguments lon, lat will
     |  convert lon/lat (in degrees) to x/y native map projection 
     |  coordinates (in meters).  If optional keyword 'inverse' is
     |  True (default is False), the inverse transformation from x/y
     |  to lon/lat is performed. If optional keyword 'radians' is True
     |  (default is False) lon/lat are interpreted as radians instead
     |  of degrees. If optional keyword 'errcheck' is True (default is 
     |  False) an exception is raised if the transformation is invalid.
     |  If errcheck=False and the transformation is invalid, no execption
     |  is raised and the platform dependent value HUGE_VAL is returned.
     |  Works with numpy and regular python array objects, python sequences
     |  and scalars, but is fastest for array objects. lon and
     |  lat must be of same type (array, list/tuple or scalar) and have the
     |  same length (if array, list or tuple).
     |  
     |  Methods defined here:
     |  
     |  __call__(self, lon, lat, inverse=False, radians=False, errcheck=False)
     |      Calling a Proj class instance with the arguments lon, lat will
     |      convert lon/lat (in degrees) to x/y native map projection 
     |      coordinates (in meters).  If optional keyword 'inverse' is
     |      True (default is False), the inverse transformation from x/y
     |      to lon/lat is performed.  If optional keyword 'radians' is
     |      True (default is False) the units of lon/lat are radians instead
     |      of degrees. If optional keyword 'errcheck' is True (default is 
     |      False) an exception is raised if the transformation is invalid.
     |      If errcheck=False and the transformation is invalid, no execption
     |      is raised and the platform dependent value HUGE_VAL is returned.
     |      
     |      Inputs should be doubles (they will be cast to doubles
     |      if they are not, causing a slight performance hit).
     |      
     |      Works with numpy and regular python array objects, python sequences
     |      and scalars, but is fastest for array objects. lon and
     |      lat must be of same type (array, list/tuple or scalar) and have the
     |      same length (if array, list or tuple).
     |  
     |  is_geocent(self)
     |      returns True if projection in geocentric (x/y) coordinates
     |  
     |  is_latlong(self)
     |      returns True if projection in geographic (lon/lat) coordinates
     |  
     |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
     |  Static methods defined here:
     |  
     |  __new__(self, projparams=None, **kwargs)
     |      initialize a Proj class instance.
     |      
     |      Proj4 projection control parameters must either be
     |      given in a dictionary 'projparams' or as keyword arguments.
     |      See the proj documentation (http://proj.maptools.org) for more
     |      information about specifying projection parameters.
     |  
     |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
     |  Data descriptors defined here:
     |  
     |  __dict__
     |      dictionary for instance variables (if defined)
     |  
     |  __weakref__
     |      list of weak references to the object (if defined)

FUNCTIONS
    transform(p1, p2, x, y, z=None, radians=False)
        x2, y2, z2 = transform(p1, p2, x1, y1, z1, radians=False)
        
        Transform points between two coordinate systems defined
        by the Proj instances p1 and p2.
        
        The points x1,y1,z1 in the coordinate system defined by p1
        are transformed to x2,y2,z2 in the coordinate system defined by p2.
        
        z1 is optional, if it is not set it is assumed to be zero (and 
        only x2 and y2 are returned).
        
        In addition to converting between cartographic and geographic
        projection coordinates, this function can take care of datum shifts
        (which cannot be done using the __call__ method of the Proj instances).
        It also allows for one of the coordinate systems to be geographic 
        (proj = 'latlong'). 
        
        If optional keyword 'radians' is True (default is False) and
        p1 is defined in geographic coordinate (pj.is_latlong() is True),
        x1,y1 is interpreted as radians instead of the default degrees.
        Similarly, if p2 is defined in geographic coordinates 
        and radians=True, x2, y2 are returned in radians instead of degrees.
        if p1.is_latlong() and p2.is_latlong() both are False, the
        radians keyword has no effect.
        
        x,y and z can be numpy or regular python arrays,
        python lists/tuples or scalars. Arrays are fastest. x,y and z must be
        all of the same type (array, list/tuple or scalar), and have the 
        same length (if arrays, lists or tuples).
        For projections in geocentric coordinates, values of
        x and y are given in meters.  z is always meters.
