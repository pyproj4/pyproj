    Sets the path to the CA Bundle used by the `curl`
    built into PROJ when PROJ network is enabled.

    - PROJ_CURL_CA_BUNDLE
    - CURL_CA_BUNDLE

        the environment variables are not set. If a path is passed in, then
        that will be the path used. If it is set to True, then it will default
        to using the path provied by the `certifi` package. If it is set to False
        or an empty string then it will default to the system settings or environment
        variables.
